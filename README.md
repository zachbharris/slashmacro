## About Slash Macro

If you play world of warcraft, then you know what macros are and how useful they can be, but how ambiguous they are and the lack of documentation provided by blizzard there is. The primary objective of Slash Macro is to teach players how to create their own macros, and provide a source for users to share their own custom macros.

## Releases

For our releases, we follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard.

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build meta data are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

You can read a great TL;DR about semantic versioning [here](https://github.com/dbrock/semver-howto).
